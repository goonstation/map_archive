Extremely ancient, it even uses the old dmp extension instead of dmm.
This is the map of goonstation as it was in March 20, 2008.

Since this map is so ungodly old, while 355.914 would be the correct version, it's visuals are corrupted. Thus, 400.952 is the next best.
Since this version has no zip, if you wish to avoid fucking up your install, you'll need to extract the exe. 7-zip works.

If you don't care that much for accuracy to the original experience, the zip of 438.1014 also does work, no promises it will act like the original though.
